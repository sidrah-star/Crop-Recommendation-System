# 🌱 Crop Recommendation System using Flask & Machine Learning

This project is a **Crop Recommendation System** built with **Flask**, **Scikit-learn**, and **Power BI** for visualization. It predicts the best crop to cultivate based on soil and weather conditions like **Nitrogen (N)**, **Phosphorus (P)**, **Potassium (K)**, **temperature**, **humidity**, **pH**, and **rainfall**.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔮 Predicts the ideal crop using a trained machine learning model.
- 🧠 Built with RandomForestClassifier for high accuracy.
- 📂 Saves all user input and predictions to a CSV file.
- 📊 Integrated with Power BI for a stunning visual dashboard.
- 🌐 Hosted using Flask and beautifully designed with HTML/CSS.
