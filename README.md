# 🌱 Crop Recommendation System using Flask & Machine Learning

This project is a **Crop Recommendation System** built with **Flask**, **Scikit-learn**, and **Power BI** for visualization. It predicts the best crop to cultivate based on soil and weather conditions like **Nitrogen (N)**, **Phosphorus (P)**, **Potassium (K)**, **temperature**, **humidity**, **pH**, and **rainfall**.
